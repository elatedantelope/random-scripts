# random-scripts
A selection of random scripts that I created for my own use and hope might be of use to others as well.
All scripts are in the public domain.

gdown.sh:

Commands Used, sh, wget, egrep, grep, awk, and sed
Use, download script and run the following commands
$ chmod +x ./gdown.sh
$ ./gdown.sh "google drive url"
